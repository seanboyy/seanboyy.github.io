The spell fails if the target lacks component pieces (such as a statue carved from one block of stone), and using it on a dangerous object like a snare or trap typically triggers it. The object gains the broken condition, and the component pieces become small enough to be hidden under normal clothing and armor. You can Dismiss the spell\nWhen the spell ends, the oobject reassembles itself into its original form, appearing in your hand or hands if you have them free, or on the ground in front of you otherwise. Once reassembled, the object loses the broken condition and its Hit POints return to the value the object had when you Cast the Spell {Heightened (4th) The spell lasts for 10 minutes || Heightened (6th) The spell lasts until your next daily preparations}

This is usually harmless to an unattended metal item, which doesn't get a saving throw, though the GM might rule that flammable materials connected to the object catch fire or melt. If you target an item worn or carried by a creature, or you target a creature made primarily of metal, the heat deals 4d6 fire damage and 2d6 persistent fire damage to the creature, which must attempt a Reflex saving throw\nIf you target an item held by the creature, the creature can Release the item to improve their degree of success by one step from the result of their saving throw.

You gain the humanoid trait in addition to your other traits while in this form, as well as any trait related to the creature's kind (such as goblin or human). If this transformation reduces your size, it reduces your reach accordingly (as the Shrink spell). This transformation doesn't change your statistics in any way, and you don't gain any special abilities of the humanoid form you assume. You can still wear and use your gear, which changes size (if necessary) to match your new form. If items leave your person, they return to their usual size.\nHumanoid Form grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to pass as a generic member of the chosen ancestry, and you add your level even if you're untrained, but you can't make yourself look like a specific person. If you want to Impersonate an individual, you still need to create a disguise, though the GM won't factor in the difference in ancestry when determining the DC of your Deception check. You can Dismiss this spell. {Heightened (3rd) You gain darkvision or low-light vision if the form you assume has that ability || Heightened (5th) You can take on the appearance of a Large humanoid. If this increases your size, you gain the effects of the Enlarge spell}
Illusory Creature	Spell	2	Auditory, Illusion, Olfactory, Visual	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	500 feet	None	None	sustained	You create an illusory image of a Large or smaller creature. It generates the appropriate sounds, smells, and feels believable to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.\nThe image can't speak, but you can use youor actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.\nIn combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain this Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC -10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or failes a  save, the spell ends.\nThe illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Stikle, the target takes mental daamge equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-The GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.\nAny creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it. {Heightened (+1) The damage of the image's Strikes increases by 1d4, and the maximum size of creature you can create increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan)}

If the target takes piercing damage, they also take 1d6 evil damage and must attempt a Fortitude save\nCritical Success The target is unaffected\nSuccess The target takes 1d6 poison damage\nFailure The target is afflicted with imp venom at stage 1\nCritical Failure The target is afflicted with imp venom at stage 2 Imp Venom (poison) Level 3; Maximum Duration 6 rounds; Stage 1 1d6 poison and clumsy 1; Stage 2 1d6 poison, clumsy 1, and slowed 1 (1 round)
Invisibility	Spell	2	Illusion	Arcane, Occult	[2] material, somatic	None	touch	1 creature	None	10 minutes	Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes invisible.

For the duration of the spell, you can reach down your throat to store or retrieve a single object of light or negligible Bulk in your stomach, as though your stomach were a backpack or other container. Storing and retrieving an item in this way requires an Interact action. The object must be small enough to reasonaably fit within your stomach. It is very difficult for other creatures to notice that you are hiding an object in this way; passive observers can't possibly notice and you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Stealth checks to Conceal the Object unless the searcher specifically searches your mouth and stomach. If at the end of the spell's duration you still have an object stored in your stomach, it is violently expelled, dealing 1d6 damage to you {Heightened (3rd) The duration increases to 8 hours}
Knock	Spell	2	Transmutatioon	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	30 feet	1 door, lock, or container	None	1 minute	You make the target easier to open. Knock grants a +4 status bonus to any creature that tries to open the taraget door, lock, or container with an Athletics or Thievery check. You can attempt a Thievery check to open the target as part of casting Knock, and you add your level even if you're untrained.\nKnock counteracts Lock
Magic Mouth	Spell	2	Auditory, Illusion, Visual	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	touch	1 creature or object	None	unlimited	You specify a trigger and a message up to 25 words long. When the specified trigger occurs within 30 feet of the target, an illusory  mouth appears on the target and speaks the message, and the Magic Mouth spell ends.
Mirror Image	Spell	2	Illusion, Visual	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	None	None	None	1 minute	Three illusory images of you swirl about your space, potentially causing those who attack you to hit one of the images instead of you. Any attack that would hit you has a random chance of hitting one of your images instead of you. If all three iamges remain, there is a 1 in 4 chance of hitting you (1 on 1d4). With two images remaining, there is a 1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1-2 on 1d6). With only one image, the chances arae 1 in 2 (1-3 on 1d6).\nOnce an image is hit, it is destroyed. If an attack roll fails to hit your AC but doesn't critically fail, it destroys an image but has no additional effect (even if the attack would normally have an effect on a failure) if an attack roll is a critical success and would hit one of the images, one of the images is destroyed and the attack roll becomoes a success against you. Once all the iamges are destroyed, the spell ends.

The spell ends after 1 round\nFailure As success, but the effect lasts 1 minute\nCritical Failure As failure, except the target believes that everyone it sees is a mortal enemy. It uses its reactions and free actions against everyone, regardless of whether they were previously its allies, as determined by the GM.

The target's response to the treasure is based on the outcome of the target's Will save\nCritical Success The target is unaffected\nSuccess The target beomces fascinated with the treasure, and the duration is until the end of its turn. The target can also try to disbelieve the illusion if it touches the treasure, Seeks to examine it, or speaks to it if the illusion appears to be a person or the like. If the target disbelieves the illusion, the spell ends\nFailure As success, but the duration is 1 minute\nCritical Failure As success, but the duration is 1 minute. The target finds the treasure so appealing that until the spell ends, it must spend each action focused on it. This can include  moving toward the treasure if the target isn't next to it, and Interacting with the treasure if the target is next to it. (If the illusion appears to be a person or the like, the target can also Interact to converse with it)

It sheds bright light in the spell's area, and dim light to twice that area.

Living creatures and undead in the area when you Cast this Spell, or that enter the area later, must attempt Fortitude saves. Living creatures that fail their Fortitude saves gain only half the normal benefit from healing effects while within the area. Undead targets that fail their Fortitude saves become enfeebled 1 while within the area.

Unlike most spells, you can gain this effect multiple times in the same round by Sustaining this Spell multiple times. The orb can move through the spaces of any creatures or obstacles that wouldn't stop the flow of water. It extinguishes non-magical fires it moves through of its size or smaller, and it attempts to counteract any magical fires it moves through. If it fails to counteract a given fire, it can't counteract that fire for the duration of the spell.\nThe orb can also collect creatures it moves through. Any Large or smaller creature whose space the orb tries to move through can attempt a Reflex save against your spell DC to avoid being engulfed. If a creature succeeds at this save, it can either let the orb pass (remaining in its space or moving out of the orb's path into a space of the creature's choice) or allow itself to be pushed in front of the orb to the end of the orb's movement. The orb can try to Engulf the same creature only once per turn, even if you roll it onto a creature's space more than once.\nA creature that fails its save is pulled into the orb. It becomes grabbed, moves along with the orb, and must hold its breath or begin suffocating (unless it can breathe in water). An engulfed Medium or smaller creature and anyone trying to affect that creature follow the normal rules for aquatic battles. An engulfed Large creature is usually big enough that parts of it stick out from the water, and it can reach out of the water. An engulfed creature can get free either by Swimming with a successful DC 10 Athletics check or by Escaping against your spell DC. A creature that critically failed its Reflex save is further stuck and must attempt to Escape instead of Swim. A freed creature exits the orb's space and can immediately breathe. The orb can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.\nWhen the spell ends, all creatures the orb has engulfed are automatically released.

When you cast this spell, choose ant, beetle, centipede, mantis, scorpion, or spider. You can decide the specific type of animal (such as a ladybug or scarab for beetle), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss this spell.\nYou gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:\n--AC=18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction. --10 temporary Hit Points --Low-light vision --One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use.

Invisibility Sphere	Spell	3	Illusion	Arcane, Occult	[2] material, somatic	10-foot emanation	None	You and any number of creatures in range	None	10 minutes	You and all targets are invisible except to each other as long as you remain within the spell's area. If a creature made invisible by this spell leaves the spell's area, it becomes visible and remains so even if it returns to the spell's area. If any creature made invisible by this spell uses a hostile action, the spell ends after the hostile action is completed.\nWHile exploring, it's easy to move together slowly and remain invisible. This is untenable in a battle, however. Once an encounter begins, creatures remain invisible until at most the end of the first round, at which point the spell ends. {Heightened (5th) The duration increases to 1 hour}
Levitate	Spell	3	Evocation	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbaal	None	touch	1 unattended object or willing creature	None	5 minutes	You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground.

A floating creature can spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If the target is adjacent to a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it can move across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical, like a wall) or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling).

If the target is a specific object, you must have observed it directly with your own senses. If it's a type of object, you still need to have an accurate mental image of the type of object. If there's lead or running water between you and the target, this spell can't locate the object. This means you might find a type of object farther away if the nearest one is behind lead or running water. {Heightened (5th) You can target a specific creature or ancestry instead of an object, but you must have met or seen up close the creature or ancestry you want to target}
Mad Monkeys	Spell	3	Conjuration	Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	5-foot burst	30 feet	None	None	sustained up to 1 minute	Magical monkey spirits fill the area as they pile and climb on top of one another.

They produce the effect listed for that mischief when you Cast this Spell and each round when you Sustain this Spell. When you Sustain this Spell, you can move the area of the monkeys by 5 feet.\n--Flagrant Burglary. The monkeys try to Steal any one item from one creature in the area. Use your spell DC - 10 as the monkeys' Thievery modifier. Their attempt relies more on distraction than subtlety, so the victim knows what item the monkeys were trying to take and whether it was taken. Getting a stolen item from the monkeys, even for the caster, requires Stealing it from them or Disarming them, using your spell DC. When the spell ends, any stolen items fall to the ground in any square of the spell's area you choose. --Raucous Din The monkeys screech loudly, potentially deafening creatures in the spell's area, interfering with complex movements. Each creature in the spell's area must attempt a Fortitude save.\nCritical Success The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 10 minutes\nSuccess the creature is unaffected\nFailure The creature is deafened for 1 minute\nCritical Failure The creature is deafened for 1 minute. --Tumultuous Gymnastics The monkeys jump and climb all over creatures in the spell's area, interfering with complex movements. Each creature in the spell's area must attempt a Reflex save.\nCritical Success The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 10 minutes\nSuccess The creature is unaffected\nFailure For 1 round, the creature must succeed at a DC 5 flat check whenever it attempts a manipulate action. If it fails this check, the creature loses that action\nCritical Failure As failure, but the monkeys cling to the creature tenaciously, and the effect lasts until the spell ends, even if the creature leaves the spell's area.

Nondetection attempts counteract all detection, revelation, and scrying divinations made against the target or the target's gear throughout the duration, counting cantrips as 1st-level spells for this purpose.

Once during the duration of this spell, the target can roll one Perception, Arcana, Crafting, Lore, Occultism, or Society initiative roll twice and use the better result, after which the spell ends. The strain of staying so prepared is too much for a mind to handle for long; the target is temporarily immune to this spell for 24 hours once the spell ends, whether they used the initiative benefit or not.

Furthermore, the spell prevents anything in the area that's prone to collapse, such as a rickety bridge or an unstable ceiling, from collapsing, except under extreme strain that would collapse a normal structure of its type.\nSafe Passage protects only against harm, not inconvenience, and it doesn't reduce difficulty terrain, remove the concealed condition caused by precipitation, or the like, nore does it protect agianst creatures within the spell's area. {Heightened (5th) The granted resistance increases to 10, and the area can be 120 feet long || Heightened (8th) The granted resistance increases to 15, and the area can be 500 feet long}

A creature who succeeds at a Perception check against you spell DC can determine that the sound was altered by an illusion, including hearing faint sounds if you deadened the sound, but they can't determine the trye sound unless they critically succeed at the Perception check. You can Dismiss this spell.\nBecause this spell obscures sound instead of preventing it, using the spell to quiet a creature doesn't prevent that creature from using verbal spell components, though it does prevent most auditory effects that rely on another creature hearing them accurately. An unwilling target can attempt a Will save\nSuccess The affected sound from the creature isn't altered.\nFaulure The affected sound from the creature is altered in the way you determine\nCritical Failure The affected sound from the creature is altered and the target becomes stupefied 2 for 1 minute as it struggles with the disorienting effects of its altered sound {Heighened (5th) You can target up to 6 creatures or 6 objects, altering the sounds of all affected creatures or objects in the same way}

Wanderer's Guide	Spell	3	Divination	Divine, Occult	1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)	None	None	None	None	until your next daily preparations	You call upon the beyond to guide your route. When you Cast this Spell, choose a destination: you receive an inspired route to that destination, allowing you and your allies who travel overland with you to reduce the movement penalty from difficult terrain by half for the duration, as long as you don't deviate from the inspired route. This doesn't have any effect on movement during encounters. If you use this ability again before the duration is over, this effect ends and is replaced by that of the new route.
Whirling Scarves	Spell	3	Abjuration, Force	Divine, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	None	None	None	1 minute	You surround yourself in a vortex of whirling colorful scarves of force that obfuscate you and disorient your foes. You gain the benefits of the concealed condition, but only against ranged and melee attacks. When a melee attack fails to hit you because of the flat check for the concealed condition, the scarves snag the weapon or unarmed attack, and the creature takes a -1 circumstance penalty to further attacks with that weapon or unarmed attack until the end of its turn (or the end of its next turn, if it wasn't the creature's turn). The timing of the scarves' movement is harder to predict for ranged attackers, so the flat check for the concealed condition against ranged attacks increases from DC 5 to DC 6. You can Dismiss this Spell {Heighened (+2) The circumstance penalty to further attacks with a melee weapon or unarmed attack the scarves snag increases by 1. The DC of the flat check for the concealed condition against ranged attacks increases by 1}

When you cast this spell, choose acid, cold, fire, electricity, or poison damage. You gain resistance 5 against that type of damage. The scales' color depends on the damage type you chose and is usually the color of a type of dragon or other creature associated with that damage type, such as red or gold for fire damage.\nThe scales store up energy as they protect you.

This space can be reached only by climbing the rope\nThe entrance to the space can't be seen, and it can be pinpointed only by the presence of the rope. The rope can't be removed or hidden, though it can be detached from the extradimensional space by pulling it with 16,000 pounds of weight, critically succeeding at an Athletics check against the spell's DC, or destroying the rope. The space hold up to eight Medium creatures and their gear. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures and a Gargantuan creature fills the space on its own.\nIf the rope is detached or destroyed, or if a creature attempts to enter the space that would put it over its capacity, the space begins to unravel.

Rusting Grasp	Spell	4	Transmutation	Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	None	touch	1 metal creature, 1 non-magical metal hazard, or 1 non-magicla metal item of up to 1 Bulk	None	0	You cause the target to rapidly rust. This magical rust can affect nonferrous materials, but the target must be all or mostly metal. Skymetals such as adamantine and orichalcum are immune to this rust, and the GM might determine other precious materials are similarly resilient. Ultimately, the GM decides if an object or creature can be targeted with this spell. All damage from this spell ignores Hardness. If the spell causes persistent damage from rust, a creature can attempt to scrape off the rust to assist the target in recovering from the persistent damage (reducing the DC of the flat check to end persistent damage to 10 and granting an immediate flat check). The effect of the spell depends on the target\n--Creature or Hazard A creaure or hazard must be made of all or mostly metal to be affected (this includes many mechanical traps). It takes 8d6 damage (basic Fortitude save), plus 2d6 persistent damage on a failed save. Touching a hazard to affect it with this spell might trigger the hazard, as determined by the GM. --Item The rust deals 2d6 damage, subject to a basic Reflex save by the creature wearing or holding the item; if the item is unattended, it automatically gets a critical failure. On a failed save, the item also takes 1d6 persistent damage. For an attended item, this persistent damage occurs at the end of the attending creature's turns; if the item was unattended when you Cast this Spell, the damage happens at the end of your turns\nWhen targeting armor someone is wearing, its Bulk is 1 higher than the listed value, since carrying armor is more cumbersome than wearing it. Thin iron or steel items, such as weapons, have 20 HP and a Broken Threshold of 10, and thicker iron or steel items, such as most suits of armor, have 36 HP and a Broken Threshold of 18. Other materials' statistics can be found in the Material Statistics section and in the entries precious materials {Heightened (+1) Increase the initial damage to creatures or hazards by 2d6, and increase the maximum Bulk of an item you can target by 1}

This spell calls on the physical body's latent memories rather than summoning back the deceased's spirit, so the corpse must be mostly intact for the spell to function.

The corpse can attempt a Will save to resist answering the questions using the statistics of the original creature at its time of death, with the following effects\nCritical Success The target can lie or refuse to answer your questions, and the target's spirit haunts you for 24 hours, bothering you and causing you to be unable to gain any rest for that time\nSuccess The target can provide false information or refuse to answer your questions\nFailure The target must answer truthfully, but its answers can be brief, cryptic, and repetitive.

The spell doesn't change voice, scent, or mannerisms. You choose the disguise for each target; for example, you could make one target appear to be a dwarf and another an elf.\nCasting Veil counts as setting up a disguise for the purpose of the Impersonate action.

If your corresponding unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead --Acrobatics(air or fire) or Athletics (earth or water) modifier of +20; ignore this change if your own modifier is higher\nYou also gain specific abilities based on the type of elemental you choose:\n--Air fly speed 80 feet, movement doesn't trigger reactions; Melee [1] gust, Damage 1d4 bludgeoning. --Earth Speed 20 feet, burrow Speed 20 feet; Melee [1] fist, Damage 2d10 bludgeoning. --Fire Speed 50 feet, fire resistance 10, weakness 5 to cold and 5 to water; Melee [1] tendril, Damage 1d8 fire plus 1d4 persistent fire. --Water Speed 20 feet, swim Speed 60 feet; fire resistance 5; Melee [1] wave, Damage 1d12 bludgeoning, and you can spend an action immediately after a hit to push the target 5 feet with the effects of a successful Shove {Heightened (6th) Your battle form is Large and your attacks have 10-foot reach.

False Vision	Spell	5	Uncommon, Illusion	Arcane, Occult	10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)	100-foot burst	touch	None	None	until the next time you make your daily preparations	You create a false image that fools any attempts to scry on an area. Any scrying spell sees, hears, smells, and otherwise detects whatever you wish within the area, rather than what is actually in the area. You can Sustain this Spell each round to change the illusion as you desire, including playing out a complex scene. If the scrying spell is of a higher level than false vision, the scryer can attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the illusion, though even if they're successful, they can't learn what's truly going on in the area.
Flame Strike	Spell	5	Evocation, Fire	Divine	[2] somatic, verbal	10-foot radius, 40-foot tall cylinder	120 feet	None	basic Reflex	0	You call a rain of divine fire that plummets down from above, dealing 8d6 fire damage. Because the flame is infused with divine energy, creatures in the area apply only half their usual fire resistance. Creatures that are immune to fire, instead of gaining the usual benefit of immunity, treat the results of their saving throws as one degree of success better. {Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6}
Grisly Growths	Spell	5	Transmutation	Arcane, Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	None	60 feet	1 corporeal creature	basic Fortitude	0	This gruesome spell causes the target to grow excess limbs and organs, whether it be fingers multiplying until hands resemble bushes, eyes popping open in bizarre places, legs sprouting from the side of th ebody, or some other result. The target takes 10d6 piercing damage (basic Fortitude save) as the new features erupt. This spell has no effect on a target with a mutable anatomy or no limbs, such as an ooze or a protean. The growths rot rapidly and fall away after 1 round.\nIn addition, unless the initial target critically succeeds, creatures within 30 feet of the target, including the target, must attempt Will saves, after which they are temporarily immune to this secondary effect of Grisly Growths for 1 hour. This additionaal effect is a mentla and visual effect\nSuccess The creature is unaffected\nFailure The creature is sickened 1\nCritical Failure the creature is sickened 2 {Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6}
Hallucination	Spell	5	Illusion, Incapacitation, Mental	Arcane, Occult	[2] material, somatic	None	30 feet	1 creature	None	1 hour	The target consistently detects one thing as another, can't detect something that's there, or detects something that's not there, though it doesn't alter their beliefs. You choose which of these effects applies, and you determine the specifics of the hallucination. For example, you could make the target see all elves as humans, be unable to detect the presence of their brother, see their beloved pocket watch on their person even when it isn't, or see a tower in the center of town\nThe target can attempt an initial Will save, with effects below. They also receive a Will save to disbelieve the hallucination every time they Seek or directly interact with the hallucination. For example, the target could attempt to disbelieve the hallucination each time they interacted with an elf, bumped into their brother accidentally, tried to check their pocked watch, or studied the tower. The target can attempt to disbelieve with a large circumstance bonus in situations determined by the GM, such as if the target attempted to climb the nonexistent tower\nCritical Success The creature is unaffected\nSuccess The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves, but it knows what the hallucination is\nFailure The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves\nCritical Failure The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves, and it trusts its false senses, taking a -4 circumstance penalty to saves to disbelieve {Heightened (6th) Choose to either target up to 10 creatures or change the spell's duration to until the next time you make your daily preparations || Heightened (8th) Choose to either targeet any number of creatures or change the spell's duration to unlimited}
Illusory Scene	Spell	5	Auditory, Illusion, Olfactory, Visual	Arcane, Primal	10 minutes (somatic, verbal)	30-foot burst	500 feet	None	None	1 hour	You form an imaginary scene that includes up to 10 discrete creatures or objects of various sizes, all of which must be within the spell's area. These elements generate appropriate sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike with the Illusory Creature spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a Hallucinatory Terrain spell.\nWhen you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion\nAny creature that touches any part of the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. If they interact with a portion of the illusion, they disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene only on a critical success {Heightened (6th) Creatures or objects in your scene can speak. You must speak the specific lines for each actor when creating your program. The spell disguises your voice for each actor || Heightened (8th) As the 6th-level version, and the duration is unlimited}
Impaling Spike	Spell	5	Conjuration	Arcane, Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	None	30 feet	1 creature	Reflex	1 minute	You conjure a spike that thrusts up from the earth beneath a target creature, potentially impaling it. The spike is made of cold iron and deals 8d6 piercing damage. The target must attempt a Reflex save.\nCritical Success The target dodges the spike and is unaffected\nSuccess The target is struck by the spike and takes half damage\nFailure The target is impaled through a leg or another non-vital body part. The creature takes full damage and, if it's standing on solid ground, becomes immobilized. It can attempt to Escap (the DC is your spell DC). While it remains impaled, it takes damage from any weakness to cold iron it has at the end of each of its turns.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the creature is impaled through a vital organ or its center of mass, taking double damage, and it is flat-footed as long as it's impaled {Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6}
Lightning Storm	Spell	5	Electricity, Evocation	Primal	[3] material, somatic, verbal	5-foot burst	120 feet	None	basic Reflex	sustained up to 1 minute	You create a black, rumbling storm cloud and call down one lightning bolt. The bolt is a vertical line from the storm cloud to the ground below, dealing 4d12 electricity damage to creatures in the spell's area (basic Reflex save). The first time you Sustain this Spell each round, you can call another  lightning bolt within the area. If you Cast this Spel outdoors, you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one, though you can still call down only one bolt per turn {Heightened (+1) The damage of each bolt increases by 1d12}
Mariner's Curse	Spell	5	Curse, Necromancy	Arcane, Occult, Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	None	touch	1 creature	Will	0	You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving sea. The target must attempt a Will save.\nCritical Success The target is unaffected\nSuccess The target becommes sickened 1. Reducing its sickened condition to 0 ends the curse\nFailure The target becomes sickened 1 and can't reduce its sickened condition below 1 while the curse remains. The curse can be lifted by Remove Curse or similar magic. Whenever the target is sickened and on the water at least a mile from shore, it is also slowed 1.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the target becomes sickened 2
Mind Probe	Spell	5	Uncommon, Divination, Linguistic, Mental	Arcane, Occult	1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)	None	30 feet	1 creature	Will	sustained up to 1 minute	You cast your thoughts through a creature's mind, sifting for information. You access the target's memories and knowledge unless it fends you off with a Will save.\nSuccess The target is unaffected\nFailure Each round of the spell's duration, you can Sustain the Spell to ask a different question and attempt to uncover the answer. For each question, the target can attempt a Deception check against your spell DC; if the target succeeds, you don't learn the answer, and on a critical success, the target gives you a false answer that you believe is truthful. Once you've asked the target a given question, asking it again, even with a separate casting of mind probe, produces the same result.\nCritical Failure As failurek, and the target takes a -4 circumstance penalty to Deception checks against your questions.
Moon Frenzy	Spell	5	Morph, Transmutation	Primal	[5] somatic, verbal	None	30 feet	up to 5 willing creatures	None	1 minute	A feral aspect overcomes the targets, making them tough and savage. Targets gain 5 temporary Hit Points, a +10-foot status bonus to their Speeds, and weakness 5 to silver. They also grow vicious fangs and claws, which are unarmed attacks. The fangs deal 2d8 piercing damage; the claws deal 2d6 slashing damage and have the agile and finesse traits. The targets use their highest weapon or unarmed attack proficiency with these attacks, and if they have weapon specialization or greater weapon specialization, they add this damage as well. On a critical hit with one of these unarmed attacks, the creature struck takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage\nThe targets can't use concentrate actions unless those actions have the rage trait, with the exception of Seek. A creature can attempt to end the spells effect on itself by using a single aciton, which has the rage trait, to attempt a Will save against your spell DC; on a success, it ends the spell's effect on itself.\nIf a target is in the light of a full moon, it also grows by one size if it were Medium or smaller. This increases the reach of a Medium or Tiny creature by 5 feet. {Heightned (6th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 10, the silver weakness to 10, and the damage dealt by the attacks to three dice || Heightened (10th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 20, the silver weakness to 20, and the damage dealth by the attacks to four dice}
Passwall	Spell	5	Uncommon, Conjuration, Earth	Arcane, Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall, 10-foot deep section of wooden, plaster, or stone wall	touch	None	None	1 hour	You create a visible tunnel through the wall in the chosen area, replacing the area with empty space. If the wall is thicker than 10 feet, the tunnel ends 10 feet in. Even a small layer of metal in the wall prevents this spell from functioning. This spell doesn't reduce the integrity of the structure. When the spell ends, anyone inside the tunnel is shunted to the nearest exit. {Heightened (7th) The tunnel can be up to 20 feet deep. The areas of the wall that contain your tunnel's entrance appear completely normal (unless viewed with True Seeing or a similar effect), despite the tunnel's existence. The tunnel's  entrance functions as a solid wall, but you can specify a password or a trigger, allowing creatrues to enter the tunnel freely}
Pillars of Sand	Spell	5	Uncommon, Conjuration, Earth	Arcane, Primal	[3] material, somatic, verbal	None	120 feet	None	None	sustained up to 1 minute	You raise one or more pillars of solid sand from the earth. The total height of the pillars is 30 feet, which must be used in 10-foot increments (for example, you could create three 10-foot-tall pillars, one 20-foot-tall pillar and one 10-foot-tall pillar, or one 30-foot tall pillar). Each pillar is 5 feet by 5 feet in length and width. The pillars must be conjured on a relatively flat area of natural earthen terrain such as sand, dirt, stone, or clay. Regardless of the terrain, the pillars are always made of tightly compacted sand particles that together become as hard and solid as stone (DC 15 Athletics to Climb).\nIf a creature occupies the space where you cast this spell, it is carried upward atop the pillar. The creature can attempt a Reflex save (DC equal to the caster's spell DC); on a success, the creature can either attempt to Grab an Egde or move into an adjacent unoccupied square. If the pillar would rise higher than the ceiling, it firmly abuts the ceiling but does not rise any higher. A creature caught between a pillar and a ceiling takes no damage (subject to GM discretion, such as is in the case of stalactites or other hazards) but becomes immobilized. The creature can attempt an Escape check to free itself, but it must thereafter Grab an Edge, CLimb down, or fall from the top of the pillar. The Grab an Edge and Escape DCs are the same as the Reflex save.\nAs part of your action to Sustain this Spell, you can choose to either destroy one of your pillars, causing it to immediately crumble into nothing, or create a new pillar, as long as doing so wouldn't exceed the total number of feet of pillar you can create. You can Sustain this Spell two or more times on a single turn to destroy or create a pillar. {Heightened (+1) The total height of the pillars increases by 10 feet, but must still be used in 10-foot increments (this also increases the total number of pillars that can be created by one)}
Plant Form	Spell	5	Plant, Polymorph, Transmutation	Primal	[2] somatic, verbala	None	None	None	None	1 minute	Taking inspiration from verdant creatures, you transform into a Large plant battle form. You must have space to expand into or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell, choose arboreal, flytrap, or shambler. You can substitute a similar specific plant to turn into (such as a pitcher plant instead of a flytrap), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the plant trait. You can Dismiss this Spell.\nYou gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:\n--AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction --12 temporary Hit points --Resistance 10 to poison --Low-light vision --One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +17, and your damage bonus is +11. These attacks are Strength based. If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead. --Athletics modifier of +19 unless your own modifier is higher.\nYou also gain specific abilities based on the type of plant you choose:\n--Arboreal Speed 30 feet; Melee [1] branch (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d10 bludgeoning; Melee [1] foot, Damage 2d8 bludgeoning; you can speak in this form, but you still can't Cast a Spell or supply verbal components --Flytrap Speed 15 feet; resistance 10 to acid; Melee [1] leaf (reach 10 feet), Damage 2d8 piercing, and you can spend an action after a hit to Grab the target --Shambler Speed 20 feet, swim Speed 20 feet; resistance 10 to electricity; Melee [1] vine (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d8 slashing. {Heightened (6th) Your battle form is Huge, and the reach of your attacks increases by 5 feet. You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 24 temporary HP, attack modifier +12, damage bonus +16, and Athletics +22}
Prying Eye	Spell	5	Divination, Scrying	Arcane, Divine, Occult	1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)	None	see effect	None	None	sustained	You create an invisible, floating eye, 1 inch in diameter, at a location you can see within 500 feet. It sees in all directions with your normal visual senses and continuously transmits what it sees to you.\nThe first time you Sustain this Spell each round, you can either move the eye up to 30 feet, seeing only things in front of the eye, or move it up to 10 feet, seeing everything in all directions around it. There is no limit to how far from you the eye can move, but the spell ends immediately if you and the eye ever cease to be on the same plane of existence. You can attempt Seek actions through the eye if you want to attempt Perception checks with it. Any damage dealt to the eye destroys it and ends the spell.
Ravening Maw	Spell	5	Uncommon, Evil, Healing, Necromancy	Divine, Occult, Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	None	60 feet	1 living creature	Will	3 rounds	You evoke Zevgavizeb's unceasing hunger and inflict it upon your target. The target becomes overwhelmed with cannibalistic hunger and can restore its vitality by feasting on the flesh of the fallen. On its turn, the target can use 2 actions (these actions have the manipulate trait) to cannibalize an adjacent dying or dead creature. If the cannibalized creature is dying, it dies. If the cannibalized creature is an ally of the target, the target regains 5d8 HP; otherwise, the target regains 5d4 HP. Certain monsters (such as those whose blood is acidic or magical) might inflict additional effects on those who canibalize them at the GM's discretion. Once cannibalized, a particular creature's body doesn't have enough meat to cannibalize agian. During any round that there's a dying or dead creature within 30 feet of the target, if the target can't or doesn't cannibalize a creature, the target takes 5d4 mental damage. {Heightened (+1) The amount of HP restored by cannibalizing a creature increases by 1d8 for eating an ally and 1d4 otherwise, and the mental damage increases by 1d4}
Secret Chest	Spell	5	Conjuration	Arcane, Occult	1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)	None	touch	1 container and its contents, totaling 10 Bulk or less	None	until the next time you make your daily preparations.	You banish a container and its contents to the Ethereal Plane, where you can retrieve it from later. The container's physical properties-the material from which it is made, any locks, or other featurs-are irrelevant to the casting of this spell, but the container can't contain any creatures. When you Cast this Spell, the container and all its contents are transported to a random location deep in the Ethereal Plane. Time passes normally for the container and its conteents, and the environmental effects of the Ethereal Plane apply to it. Though very unlikely, it's possible for a creature on the Ethereal Plane to stumble upon the chest.\nYou can Dismiss this spell to return the chest to your current location. If the spell ends by any other means, the container is lost on the Ethereal Plane and you can no longer recall it with this spell, though you could search for it in other ways.
Sending	Spell	5	Divination, Mental	Arcane, Divine, Occult	[3] material, somatic, verbal	None	planetary	1 creature with whom you are familiar	None	0	You send the creature a mental message of 25 words or fewer, and it can respond immediately with its own messag of 25 words or fewer.
Shadow Blast	Spell	5	Evocation, Shadow	Divine, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	varies	varies	None	basic Reflex or Will (target's choice)	0	You shape the quasi-real substance of the Shadow Plane into a blast. Choose acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, force, piercing, slashing, or sonic damage, and choose a 30-foot cone, a 15-foot burst within 120 feet, or a 50-foot line. The blast deals 5d8 damage of the type you chose to each creature in the area {Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d8}
Shadow Siphon	Spell	5	Illusion, Shadow	Arcane, Occult	[R] verbal A spell or magical effect deals damage.	None	60 feet	the triggering spell	None	0	Exchanging material energy with that of the Shadow Plane, you transform the triggering spell into a paartially illusory version of itself. Attempt to counteract the target spell. If the attempt is successful, any creatures that would be damaged by the spell instead take only half as much damage, but the spell otherwise works as normal. Treat Shadow Siphon's counteract level as 2 higher for this attempt.
Shadow Walk	Spell	5	Uncommon, Conjuration, Shadow, Teleportation	Arcane, Occult	1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)	None	touch	you and up to 9 willing creatures touched	None	8 hours	You access the Shadow Plane, using its warped nature to spread your travels. The targets enter the edge of the Shadow Plane where it borders the Material Plane. Targets can't see the Material Plane while on the Shadow Plane (although elements of that plane can sometimes be a hazy reflection of the Material Plane). While on the Shadow Plane, the targets are exposed to potential encounters with that plane's denizens. The shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 3 minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can Dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling together and Dismiss the spell at the same point on the Plane of Shadow appear together)
Spiritual Guardian	Spell	5	Abjuration, Force	Divine	[2] somatic, verbal You must have a deity	None	120 feet	None	None	sustained up to 1 minute	A Medium guardian made of magical force appears and attacks foes you designate within range. The spiritual guardian is translucent and appears to be holding your deity's favored weapon.\nWhen you Cast this Spell, the spiritual guardian appears in an unoccupied space next to a foe of your choice within range and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Sustain This Spell, you can move the guardian to an unoccupied space next to a target within range (if necessary) and make a Strike with it. The guardian uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, when you Sustain the Spell, you can have the guardian move adjacent to an ally and protect that ally. If you do, each time the ally would take damage, the guardian takes the first 10 damage instead of your ally. It continues to do so until you move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different ally,, or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 50 Hit Points, and can't recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can't usually take damage except when protecting an ally, though Disintegrate automatically destroys it if it hits the guardian's AC of 25.\nThe guardian's Stikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless of the appearance of the guardian's weapon, the guardian deals force damage equal to 2d8+your spellcasting ability modifier, but you can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon it holds instead of force damage. No other traits or statistics of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual guardian's weapon is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistance, and so forth.\nThe guardian takes up space and allies can use it when flanking, but it doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have aside from Hit Points, and creatures can move though its space without hindrance. The guardian can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons or enhance allies do not apply to the guardian. {Heightened (+2) the guardian's damage increases by 1d8, and its Hit Points increase by 20}
Strange Geometry	Spell	5	Illusion	Occult	[3] material, somatic, verbal	4 cubes, each 10 feet on a side	60 feet	None	Will	1 minute	You cause the areas to appear to swell, bend, and break, twisting together in a bizarre spatial geometry. The cubes of the spell's area can't be adjacent to one other. A creature must attempt a Will save if it's in one of the cubes when you Cast this Spell, or if it later enters one of the areas, with the following effects. A creature interacting with the illusion can also attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion, as normal.\nSuccess The creature disbelieves the illusion\nFailure All terrain in the cubes is difficult terrain for the creature, including the air if the creature is flying, walls if it's climbing, and so on. When the creature would exit one of the cubes, it exits from one randomly determined by the GM. This is a teleportation effect. It can exit from any edge of that cube it chooses. When selecting a random cube, the GM excludes any that don't match the creature's terrain; for instance, if the creature were exiting along the ground, the GM would exclude any cube that didn't have an exit on the ground.
Subconscious Suggestion	Spell	5	Enchantment, Incapacitation, Linguistic, Mental	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	30 feet	1 creature	Will	varies	You implant a subconscious suggestion deep within the target's mind for them to follow when a trigger you specify occurs. You suggest a course of action to the target. Your directive must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target, and it can't be self-destructive or obviously against the target's self-interes. The target must attempt a Will save.\nCritical Success The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.\nSuccess The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.\nFailure The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious until the next time you prepare. If the trigger occurs before then, the target immediately follows your suggestion. The effect has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects\nCritical Failure As failure, but the duration is 1 hour. {Heightened (9th) You can target up to 10 creatures}
Summon Celestial	Spell	5	Conjuration	Divine	[3] material, somatic, verbal	None	30 feet	None	None	sustained up to 1 minute	You conjure a celestial to fight on your behalf. This works like Summon Animal, except you summon a common creature that has the celestial trait and whose level is 5 or lower. You can't summon a creature unless its alignment is one of your deity's preferred alignments (or, if you don't have a deity, is within one step of your alignment). At the GM's discretion, some deities might restrict specific types of celestials, even if their alignments match. {Heightened (6th) Level 7 || Heightened (7th) Level 9 || Heightened (8th) Level 11 || Heightened (9th) Level 13 || Heightened (10th) Level 15}

At the GM's discretion, some deities might restrict specific types of fiends, even if their alignments match. {Heightened (6th) Level 7 || Heightened (7th) Level 9 || Heightened (8th) Level 11 || Heightened (9th) Level 13 || Heightened (10th) Level 15}

Choose a 1st-level spell you prepared today or that's in your repertoire, of the same tradition you used to cast Halcyon Infusion. The spell must be one that has a listed range. If the target is at least 3rd level, you can choose a 2nd-level spell instead of a 1st-level spell; and if the target is at least 5th level, you can choose a 3rd-level spell.

If they are untrained in the appropriate magical tradition, their spell attack bonus is 2 + their level + their highest mental ability modifier, and their spell DC is 12 + their level + their highest mental ability modifier.

Mislead	Spell	6	Illusion	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	None	None	None	sustained up to 1 minute	You turn yourself invisible and create an illusory duplicate of yourself. When you Sustain this Spell, you can mentally dictate a course of action for your duplicate to follow that round. Your duplicate acts as though it had your full number of actions, though it can't actually affect anything in the environment. Both the duplicate and your invisiblity persist for the spell's duration. Performing a hostile action doesn't end Mislead's invisibility, just like a 4th-level Invisibility spell. A creature that determines the duplicate is an illusion doesn't necessarily know your invisible, and one that can see your invisible form doesn't necessarily know your duplicate is an illusion\nIf you Cast a Spell, attack, or otherwise interact with another creature, as a part of that action you can attempt a Deception check against observers' Perception DCs to convince them your duplicate used that action. This doesn't fool anyone who's aware your duplicate is an illusion, nor does it work if the attack obviously couldn't have come from the duplicate. For instance, if you fired a ray, you could make it look like it came from the duplicate as long as the duplicate was positioned appropriately, but if yyou attacked with a sword and your duplicate was across the room from the target, your Deception check would automatically fail.

The time spent in the Boneyard leaves the target temporarily debilitated, making it clumsy 2, drained 2, and enfeebled 2 for 1 week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. The creature is also permanently changed by its time in the afterlife, such as a slight personality shify, a streak of white in the hair, or a strange new birthmark. {Heightened (7th) The maximum level of the target increases to 15. The cost increases to the target's level (minimum 1) x 400 gp || Heightened (8th) The maximum level of the creature increases to 17. The cost increases to the target's level (minimum 1) x 800 gp || Heightened (9th) The maximum level of the target increases to 19.

Scrying	Spell	6	Uncommon, Divination, Scrying	Arcane, Occult	10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)	None	planetary	1 creature	Will	sustained up to 10 minute	You magically spy on a creature of your choice. Scrying works like Clairvoyance, except that the image you receive is less precise, insufficient for Teleport and similar spells. Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that manifests just above the target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven't met the target in person, Scrying's DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower.\nThe effect of Scrying depends on the target's Will save\nCritical Success The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 week. The target also gains a glimpse of you and learns its rough distance and direction from you\nSuccess The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 day\nFailure The spell succeeds\nCritical Failure The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the target if it moves, traveling up to 60 feet per round

The target must attempt a Will save\nCricital Success The target is unaffected\nSuccess Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes 2d12 persistent force damage.

Spirit Blast	Spell	6	Force, Necromancy	Divine, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	30 feet	1 creature	basic Fortitude	0	You concentrate ethereal energy and attack a creature's spirit, dealing 16d6 force damage. Because spirit blast affects the creature's spirit, it can damage a target projecting its consciousness (such as via Project Image) or possessing another creature even if the target's body is elsewhere. The possessed creature isn't harmed by the blast. The blast doesn't harm creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs {Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6}
Stone Tell	Spell	6	Uncommon, Earth, Evocation	Divine, Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	None	None	None	None	10 minutes	You can ask questions of and receive answers from natural or worked stone. While stone is not intelligent, you speak with the natural spirits of the stone, which have a personality colored by the type of stone, as well as by the type of structure the stone is part of, for worked stone. A stone's perspective, perception, and knowledge give it a worldview different enough from a human's that it doesn't consider the same details important. Stones can mostly answer questions about creatures that touched them in the past and what is concealed beneath or behind them.
Stone to Flesh	Spell	6	Earth, Transmutation	Divine, Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	None	touch	petrified creature or human-size stone object	None	0	Manipulating the fundamental particles of matter, you convert stone into flesh and blood.

Any creature moving on the land, or Climbing or Swimming within the creepers, takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the area. Once per round, you can make a vine lash out from any square within the expanse of creepers by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This vine has a 15-foot reach. Make a melee spell attack roll against the target; on a success, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes it immobilized for 1 round or until the creature Escapes (against your spell DC), whichever comes first.
Teleport	Spell	6	Uncommon, Conjuration, Teleportation	Arcane, Occult	10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)	None	100 miles	you and up to 4 targets touched, either willing creatures or objects roughly the size of a creature	None	0	You and the targets are instantly transported to any location within range, as long as you can identify the location precisely both by its position relative to your starting position and by its appearance (or other identifying features). Incorrect knowledge of the location's appearance usually causes the spell to fail, but it could instead lead to teleporting to an unwanted location or some other mishap determined by the GM. Teleport is not precise over great distances. The targets appear at a distance from the intended destination equal to roughly 1 percent of the total distance traveled, in a direction determined by the GM. For short journeys, this lack of precision is irrelevant, but for long distances this could be up to 1 mile. {Heightened (7th) You and the other targets can travel to any location within 1000 miles || Heightened (8th) You and the other targets can travel to any location on the same planet. If you travel more than 1000 miles, you arrive only 10 miles off target. || Heightened (9th) You and the other targets caan travel to any location on another planet within the same solar system. Assuming you have accurate knowledge of the location's position and appearance, you arrive on the new planet 100 miles off target. || Heightened (10th) As the 9th-level version, but you and the other targets can travel to any planet within the same galaxy}
True Seeing	Spell	6	Divination, Revelation	Arcane, Divine, Occult, Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	None	None	None	None	10 minutes	You see things within 60 feet as they actually are. The GM rolls a secret counteract check against any illusion or transmutation in the area, but only for the purpose of determining whether you see through it (for instance, if the check succeeds against a polymorph spell, you can see the creature's true form, but you don't end the polymorph spell)
Vampiric Exsanguination	Spell	6	Death, Necromancy, Negative	Arcane, Divine, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	30-foot cone	None	None	basic Fortitude	0	You draw in the blood and life force of other creatures through your outstretched arms. You deal 12d6 negative damage to living creatures in the area.\nYou gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage a single creature takes from this spell; calculate these temporary Hit Points using the creature that took the most damage. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute {Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6}
Vibrant Paattern	Spell	6	Illusion, Incapacitation, Visual	Arcane, Occult	[2] material, somatic	10-foot burst	120 feet	None	Will	sustained up to 1 minute	You create a pattern of lights that pulses with intensity. Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern.\nIn addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it's inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently blinded by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws\nSuccess The creature is unaffected\nFailure The creature is blinded by the pattern. If it exits the pattern, it can attempt a new save to recover from the blinded condition at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of 1 minute\nCritical Failure The creature is blinded for 1 minute

The wall has no discernable thickness. You must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. The wall has AC 10, Hardness 30, and 60 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage. The wall blocks physical effects from passing through it, and because it's made of force, it blocks incorporeal and ethereal creatures as well. Teleportation effects can pass through the barrier, as can visual effects (since the wall is invisible)\nWall of Force is immune to counteracting effects of its level or lower, but the wall is automatically destroyed by a disintegrate spell of any level or by contact with a Rod of Cancellation or Sphere of Annihilation {Heightened (+2) The Hit Points of the wall increases by 20}
Zealous Conviction	Spell	6	Emotion, Enchantment, Mental	Divine, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	30 feet	up to 10 willing creatures	None	10 minutes	You bypass your targets' rational minds, instilling them, with unshakable conviction and zeal. The targets each gain 12 temporary Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to Will saves against mental effects, as their faith overrides the signals from their own bodies and minds. If you tell a target to do something, it must comply with your request, though if it would normally find the task repugnant, it can attempt a Will save at the end of its turn each round due to the cognitive dissonance. On a success, it ends the spell's effects on itself entirely {Heightened (9th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 18, and the status bonus to Will saves to +3}

Creatures who fail their save are afflicted with stage 1 of blightburn sickenss (on a critical failure, the creature moves immediately to stage 2).

Contingency	Spell	7	Abjuration	Arcane	10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)	None	None	None	None	24 hours	You prepare a spell that will trigger later.  While casting Contingency, you also cast another spell of 4th level or lower with a casting time of no more than 3 actions. This companion spell must be one that can affect you. You must make any decisions for the spell when you cast Contingency, such as choosing a damage type for resist energy. During the casting, choose a trigger under which the spell will be cast, using the same restrictions as for the trigger of a Ready action. Once Contingency is cast, you can cause the companion spell to come into effect as a reaction with that trigger. It affects only you, even if it would affect more creatures. If you define complicated conditions, as determined by the GM, the trigger might fail. If you cast Contingency again, the newer casting supersedes the older {Heightened (8th) You can choose a spell of 5th level or lower || Heightened (9th) You can choose a spell of 6th level or lower || Heightened (10th) You can choose a spell of 7th level or lower}

On subsequent rounds, you can switch to a different effect once per round as a free action triggered by Sustaining this Spell.\n--Sand Shield You create a magical shield made of sand.

If the spell ends during an encounter, you act just before the possessed creature's initiative count.\nCritical Success The target is unaffected\nSuccess You possess the target but can't control it. You ride along in the body while the spell lasts.\nFailure You possess the target and take partial control of it. You no longer have a separate turn; instead, you might control the target. At the start of each of the target's turns, it attempts another Will save. If it fails, it's controlled by you on that turn; if it succeeds, it chooses its own actions; and if it critically succeeds, it forces you out and the spell ends.\nCritical Failure You possess the target fully, and it can only watch as you manipulate it like a puppet. The target is controlled by you {Heightened (9th) The duration is 10 minutes, and you can physically enter the creature's body, protecting your physical body while the spell lasts}

Each creature in the area must roll 1d8 on the table below to see which beam affects it, then attempt a saving throw of the indicated type. The table notes any additional traits that apply to each type of ray. If a creature is struck by multiple beams, it uses the same d20 result for all its saving throws. For all rays, a successfult saving throw negates the effect for that creature [TABLE]{1d8 | Color | Save | Effect(Traits)\n1 | Red | Reflex | 50 fire damage (fire)\n2 | Orange | Reflex | 60 acid damage (acid)\n3 | Yellow | Reflex | 70 electricity damage (electricity)\n4 | Green | Fortitiude | 30 poison damage and enfeebled 1 for 1 minute (poison)\n5 | Blue | Fortitude | Affected as if by Flesh to Stone\n6 | Indigo | Will | Confused, as the Warp Mind spell (mental)\n7 | Violet | Will | Slowed for 1 minute; if a critical failure, sent to another pplane, as Plane Shift (teleportation)\n8 | Potent Beam | - | Affected by two beams - roll twice, rerolling any duplicates or results of 8}
Project Image	Spell	7	Illusion, Mental	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	30 feet	None	None	sustained up to 1 minute	You project an illusory image of yourself. You must stay within range of the image, and if at any point you can't see the image, the spell ends. Whenever you Cast a Spell other than one whose area is an emanation, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it can't benefit from spells, though visual manifestations of the spell appear. The image has the same AC and saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends. {Heightened (+2) The maximum duration you can Sustain this Spell increases to 10 minutes}
Regenerate	Spell	7	Healing, Necromancy, Positive	Divine, Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	None	touch	1 willing living creature	None	1 minute	An infusion of positive energy grants a creature continuous healing. The target temporarily gains regeneration 15, which restores 15 Hit Points at the start of each of its turns. While it has regeneration, the target can't die from damage and its dying condition can't increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3), thos if its wounded value becomes 4 or higher, it stays unconscious until its wounds are treated. If the target takes acid or fire damage, its regeneration deactivates until after the end of its next turn\nEach time the creature regains Hit Points from regeneration, it also regrows one damaged or ruined organ (if any). During the spell's duration, the creature can also reattach severed body parts by spending an Interact action to hold the body part to the area it was severed from. {Heightened (9th) The regeneration increases to 20}
Retrocognition	Spell	7	Divination	Occult	1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)	None	None	None	None	sustained	Opening your mind to occult echoes, you gain impressions from pastr events that occurred in your current location. Retrocognition reveals psychic impressions from events that occurred over the course of the last day throughout the first minute of the duration, followed by impressions from the next day back the next minute, and so on. These echoes don't play out like a vision but instead reveal impressions of emotions and metaphors that provide cryptic clues and details of the past. If you witness a traumatic or turbulent event through an impression, the spell ends unless you succeed at a Will save with a DC of at least 30 and possibly as much as 50, depending on the severity of the event. The GM determines whether an event is traumatic and chooses the DC. {Heightened (8th) You gain impressions of events that occurred over the previous year for each minute you concentrate, instead of the previous day, though the details diminish, making it harder to distinguish impressions from all but the most major events || Heightened (9th) You gain impressions of events that occurred over the previous century for each minute you concentrate, instead of the previous day, though the details diminish, making it almost impossible to distinguish impressions from all but the most major events}
Reverse Gravity	Spell	7	Uncommon, Evocation	Arcane, Occult	[3] material, somatic, verbal	20-foot radius, 40-foot-tall cylinder	120 feet	None	None	1 minute	You reverse gravity in the area. Creatures and objects that aren't secured to the ground immediately fall upward to the top of the area. A creature might be able to Grab an Edge to arrest its fall if it falls past an appropriate surface. If a creature falls against a solid object (such as a ceiling), it takes the appropriate amount of falling damage and lands on the surface. Once an object or creature reaches the top of the area, it floats, caught between the normal and reversed gravity. The creature can move along the plane where the two forms of gravity meet. Creatures that can levitate or fly can use those abilities to mitigate the effects of Reverse Gravity\nWhen Reverse Gravity ends, all creatures and objects caught in the area fall back down. Likewise, anything that moves beyond the spell's area is subjected to normal gravity again.
Spell Turning	Spell	7	Uncommon, Abjuration	Arcane	[2] somatic, verbal	None	None	None	None	1 hour	THis abjuration reflects spells cast at you back at their casater. When a spell targets you, you can spend a reaction to attempt to reflect it. This uses the rules for counteracting the spell, but if the spell is suuccessfully counteracted, the effect is turnned back on the caster. Whether or not the counteract attempt is successful, Spell Turning then ends. Spell Turning can't affect spells that aren't targeted (such as area spells)\nIf Spell Turning reflects a spell back at a caster who is also under the effect of Spell Turning, their Spell Turning can attempt to reflect their own spell back at you agin; if they do so, their counteract attempt automatically succeeds.

You can cast Time Beacon on only your turn. Keep careful track of everything that happens this turn after you cast Time Beacon. At the end of your turn, you can choose to rewind time back to just after you cast Time Beacon, removing all effects of your turn since then. Curses, traps, and other harmful effects that happen during your turn might prevent you from returning to the beacon if they are powerful enough. If you suffered any harmful effects during your turn after casting Time Beacon, to return to your beacon, Time Beacon attempts a counteract check against each such effect. If it fails at any of these checks, you can’t return.
True Target	Spell	7	Divination, Fortune, Prediction	Arcane, Occult	[1] verbal	None	60 feet	4 creatures	None	until the start of your next turn	You delve into the possible futures of the next few seconds to understand all the ways your foe might avoid harm, then cast out a vision of that future to those around you.

Unfettered Pack	Spell	7	Abjuration	Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	None	30 feet	up to 10 creatures	None	1 hour	You free those who travel alongside you from environmental hindrances.

A creature that critically succeeds at its Will save can immediately attempt to disbelieve the illusion. A creature that tries to Interact with the monsters or observes one with a Seek action can attempt to disbelieve the illusion. Creatures that disbelieve the illusion take no damage from the illusion thereafter. {Heightened (+1) The mental damage increases by 1d8}
Volcanic Eruption	Spell	7	Evocation, Fire	Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	5-foot radius, 80-foot tall cylinder	120 feet	None	Reflex	0	The ground opens up, spraying a column of lava high into the air in a vertical cylinder, dealing 14d6 fire damage to creatures in the area. The lava rapidly cools and encases creatures in the area. A creature encased in rock is clumsy 1 and takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to a flying creature, and such creatures immediately descend 20 feet the moment they're encased, but they don't take damage from this fall. A creature encased in rock can attempt to Escape against your spell DC to end the effect. Otherwwise the creature remains encased until it takes a total of 50 damage, freeing it from the rock.\nAdditionally, creatures in the area and those within 5 feet of the lava column automatically take  3d6 fire damage from mthe intense heat, regardless of the results of their saving throws.\nCritical Success The creature is unaffected\nSuccess The creature takes half damage\nFailure The creature takes full damage and is encased\nCritical Failure The creature takes double damage and is encased {Heightened (+1) The damage in the area increases by 2d6, and the damage from the intense heat increases by 1d6}

The target must attempt a Will saving throw. Regardless of the result of that save, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. Warp Mind's effects happen instantly, so Dispel Magic and other effects that counteract spells can't counteract them. However, Alter Reality, Miracle, Primal Phenomenon, Restoration, or Wish can still counteract the effects\nCritical Success The target is unaffected\nSuccess The target spends the first aciton on its next turn with the confused condition\nFailure The target is confused for 1 minute\nCritical Failure The target is confused permanently

When you separate the targets back into themselves, you can choose to switch the positions of any number of targets with the positions of other targets. Additionally, you can modulate the share of vital essence to share the burden of pain.

Spells can't penetrate the area, magic items cease to function within it, and no one inside can cast spells or use magic abilities. Likewise, spells-such as Dispell Magic-can't affect the field itself unless they are of a higher level. Magic effects resume the moment they pass outside the field. For example, a ray fired from one side of the field could target a creatuure on the other side (as long as caster and target are both outside the field). A summoned creature winks out of existence but reappears if the field moves or ends. Invested magic items cease to function, but they remain invested and resume functioning when they exit the field; the ability boost from an apex item isn't suppressed within the field. Spells of a higher level than the Antimagic Field overcome its effects, ,and can even be cast by a creature within the field\nThe field disrupts only magic, so a +3 longsword still functions as a longsword. Magically created creatures (such as golems) function normally within an Antimagic Field
Deluge	Spell	8	Uncommon, Evocation, Water	Arcane, Primal	[2]  somatic, verbal	40-foot burst	500 feet	None	None	0	You unleash a catastrophic downpour in the area that vanishes an instant later.

Creatures on the ground, including flying creatures forced to the ground by the spell, must succeed at a Reflex save or be pushed 50 feet away from the center of the area.\nFlimsy strictures in the area collapse. The GM can determine other large-scale effects that result from the Deluge {Heightened (+1) The area increases by 10 feet, and flying creatures fall an additional 10 feet}

Disappearance	Spell	8	Illusion	Arcane, Occult	[2] material, somatic	None	touch	1 creature	None	10 minutes	You shroud a creature from others' senses. The target becomes undetected, not just to sight but to all senses, allowing the target to count as invisible no matter what precise and imprecise senses an observer might have. It's still possible for a creature to find the target by Seeking, looking for disturbed dust, hearing gaps in the sound spectrum, or finding some other way to discover the presence of an otherwise-undetectable creature.
Discern Location	Spell	8	Uncommon, Detection, Divination	Arcane, Divine, Occult	10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)	None	unlimited	1 creature or object	None	0	You learn the name of the target's exact location (including the building, community, and country) and plane of existence.\nYou can target a creature only if you've seen it in person, have one of its significant belongings, or have a piece of its body. To target an object, you must have touched it or have a fragment of it. Discern Location automatically overcomes protections against detection and divination of lower level than this spell, even if they would have a chance to block it.
Divine Aura	Spell	8	Abjuration	Divine	[2] somatic, verbal	10-foot emanation	None	allies in the area	None	sustained up to 1 mminute	Divine power wards the targgets, granting each a +1 status bonuus to AC and saves while in the area.\nChoose an alignment your deity has. You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or your deity is true neutral. This spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose. The bonuses granted by the spell increase to +2 against attacks by-and effects created by-creatures with an alignment opposite to the spell. These bonuses increase to +4 against effects created by such creatures that attempt to impose the controlled condition on a target of your Divine Aura, as well as against attacks made by creatures summoned by anything opposite in alignment to your Divine Aura.\nWhen a creature of opposite alignment hits a target with a melee attack, the creature must succeed at a Will save or be blinded for 1 minute.

Cliffs might collapse, causing creatures to fall, or a lake might drain as fissures open up below its surface, leaving a morass of quicksand\n--Shaking Ground The ground is difficult terrain, and creatures on it take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks --Fissures Each creature on the grouond must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into the 40-foot-deep fissures that open beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides require DC 15 Athletics to Climb --Collapse Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit).

Once each turn, the target can spend 1 action to attempt a Survival check or a Perception check against your spell DC to escape the maze. The possible outcomes are below.\nTeleportation magic doesn't help the creature escape unless the magic can transport across planes, such as Plane Shift. When the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the duration ran out, the target returns to the space it occupied when it was banished, or to the nearest space if the original is now filled.\nCritical Success The target escapes and the spell ends\nSuccess The target is on the right path to the exit. If the target was already on the right path, it escapes the maze and the spell ends\nFailure The target makes no progress toward escape\nCritical Failure THe target makes no progress  toward escape, and if it was on the right path, it no longer is
Mind Blank	Spell	8	Uncommon, Abjuration	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	30 feet	1 creature	None	until the next time you make your daily preparations	Powerful wards hide a creature from divination magic. The target gains a +4 status bonus to saves against mental effects. Mind Blank attempts to counteract any detection, revelation, and scrying effects as if its spell level were 1 higher than its actual level.

The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and 30 feet high. You must form the wall in an unbroken space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. You can pass through the wall and ignore its effects. The wall sheds bright light out to 20 feet on each side (and dim light to the next 20 feet). Creatures other than you that come into the wal's light must attempt a Will save; they're dazzled for 1 round on a success, blinded for 1 round on a failure, and blinded for 1 minute on a critical failure. They are then temporarily immune to the blinding effect for 1 hour.\nA Prismatic Wall has seven different layers, each a different color. Red, orange, yellow, and green have the effect of a 5th-Level Chromatic Wall spell of that color, and the others have the effect of a 7th-level Chromatic Wall sppell of that color. A creature that tries to pass through the wall must attempt a saving throw against each component wall. The effects take place simultaneously, so a creature turned to stone by the blue wall is still treated as a creature for the indigo and violet walls.\nThe wall as a whole is immune to counteracting effects of the wall's level or lower; each color must be counteracted by its specific spell, as described in Chromatic Wall. This must be done in order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, then violet). A given color can't be affected until the previous color is counteracted. Counteracting a color wall removes that color's effect from the wall, and counteracting them all ends Prismatic Wall. You can Dismiss this spell.

Any damage to an eye destroys it. When all eyes are destroyed, the spell ends.\nAs a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can concentrate on a location within the area that an eye can reach. An eye travels to that location, and you Seek visually as if you were there. As an exploration activity, you can travel at half speed while continuing to concentrate on the eyes to gain the benefits of both the Scout and Search activities. With the eyes, you can check everything even if you are traveling faster than 300 feet per minute. The eyes use your Perception modifier. You can have only one Prying Survey in effect at a time. {Heightened (10th) The area increases to a 500-foot emanation}

All flying creatures in the area descend 40 feet. The entire is greater difficult terrain for Flying creatures, and difficult terain for creatures on the ground or Climbing. Any creature that ends its turn Flying within the area descends 20 feet. Any creature pushed into a surface by this spell's winds takes bludgeoning damage as though it had fallen.\nThe squares at the outside vertical edges of the cylinder prevent creatures from leaving. These squares are greater difficult terrain, and a creature attempting to push through must succeed at an Athletics check or Acrobatics check to Maneuver in Flight against your spell DC to get through. A creature that fails ends its current action but can try again.
Scintillating Pattern	Spell	8	Illusion, Incapacitation, Visual	Arcane, Occult	[2] material, somatic	20-foot burst	120 feet	None	Will	sustained up to 1 minute	A field of cascading, ever-changing colors manifests in the air.

A creature currently affected by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saves.\nSuccess The creature is unaffected\nFailure The creature is confused for 1d4 rounds\nCritical Failure The creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds.
