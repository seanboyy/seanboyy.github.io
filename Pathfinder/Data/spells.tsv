The spell fails if the target lacks component pieces (such as a statue carved from one block of stone), and using it on a dangerous object like a snare or trap typically triggers it. The object gains the broken condition, and the component pieces become small enough to be hidden under normal clothing and armor. You can Dismiss the spell\nWhen the spell ends, the oobject reassembles itself into its original form, appearing in your hand or hands if you have them free, or on the ground in front of you otherwise. Once reassembled, the object loses the broken condition and its Hit POints return to the value the object had when you Cast the Spell {Heightened (4th) The spell lasts for 10 minutes || Heightened (6th) The spell lasts until your next daily preparations}

This is usually harmless to an unattended metal item, which doesn't get a saving throw, though the GM might rule that flammable materials connected to the object catch fire or melt. If you target an item worn or carried by a creature, or you target a creature made primarily of metal, the heat deals 4d6 fire damage and 2d6 persistent fire damage to the creature, which must attempt a Reflex saving throw\nIf you target an item held by the creature, the creature can Release the item to improve their degree of success by one step from the result of their saving throw.

You gain the humanoid trait in addition to your other traits while in this form, as well as any trait related to the creature's kind (such as goblin or human). If this transformation reduces your size, it reduces your reach accordingly (as the Shrink spell). This transformation doesn't change your statistics in any way, and you don't gain any special abilities of the humanoid form you assume. You can still wear and use your gear, which changes size (if necessary) to match your new form. If items leave your person, they return to their usual size.\nHumanoid Form grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to pass as a generic member of the chosen ancestry, and you add your level even if you're untrained, but you can't make yourself look like a specific person. If you want to Impersonate an individual, you still need to create a disguise, though the GM won't factor in the difference in ancestry when determining the DC of your Deception check. You can Dismiss this spell. {Heightened (3rd) You gain darkvision or low-light vision if the form you assume has that ability || Heightened (5th) You can take on the appearance of a Large humanoid. If this increases your size, you gain the effects of the Enlarge spell}
Illusory Creature	Spell	2	Auditory, Illusion, Olfactory, Visual	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	500 feet	None	None	sustained	You create an illusory image of a Large or smaller creature. It generates the appropriate sounds, smells, and feels believable to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.\nThe image can't speak, but you can use youor actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.\nIn combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain this Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC -10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or failes a  save, the spell ends.\nThe illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Stikle, the target takes mental daamge equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-The GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.\nAny creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it. {Heightened (+1) The damage of the image's Strikes increases by 1d4, and the maximum size of creature you can create increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan)}

If the target takes piercing damage, they also take 1d6 evil damage and must attempt a Fortitude save\nCritical Success The target is unaffected\nSuccess The target takes 1d6 poison damage\nFailure The target is afflicted with imp venom at stage 1\nCritical Failure The target is afflicted with imp venom at stage 2 Imp Venom (poison) Level 3; Maximum Duration 6 rounds; Stage 1 1d6 poison and clumsy 1; Stage 2 1d6 poison, clumsy 1, and slowed 1 (1 round)
Invisibility	Spell	2	Illusion	Arcane, Occult	[2] material, somatic	None	touch	1 creature	None	10 minutes	Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes invisible.

For the duration of the spell, you can reach down your throat to store or retrieve a single object of light or negligible Bulk in your stomach, as though your stomach were a backpack or other container. Storing and retrieving an item in this way requires an Interact action. The object must be small enough to reasonaably fit within your stomach. It is very difficult for other creatures to notice that you are hiding an object in this way; passive observers can't possibly notice and you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Stealth checks to Conceal the Object unless the searcher specifically searches your mouth and stomach. If at the end of the spell's duration you still have an object stored in your stomach, it is violently expelled, dealing 1d6 damage to you {Heightened (3rd) The duration increases to 8 hours}
Knock	Spell	2	Transmutatioon	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	30 feet	1 door, lock, or container	None	1 minute	You make the target easier to open. Knock grants a +4 status bonus to any creature that tries to open the taraget door, lock, or container with an Athletics or Thievery check. You can attempt a Thievery check to open the target as part of casting Knock, and you add your level even if you're untrained.\nKnock counteracts Lock
Magic Mouth	Spell	2	Auditory, Illusion, Visual	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	touch	1 creature or object	None	unlimited	You specify a trigger and a message up to 25 words long. When the specified trigger occurs within 30 feet of the target, an illusory  mouth appears on the target and speaks the message, and the Magic Mouth spell ends.
Mirror Image	Spell	2	Illusion, Visual	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	None	None	None	1 minute	Three illusory images of you swirl about your space, potentially causing those who attack you to hit one of the images instead of you. Any attack that would hit you has a random chance of hitting one of your images instead of you. If all three iamges remain, there is a 1 in 4 chance of hitting you (1 on 1d4). With two images remaining, there is a 1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1-2 on 1d6). With only one image, the chances arae 1 in 2 (1-3 on 1d6).\nOnce an image is hit, it is destroyed. If an attack roll fails to hit your AC but doesn't critically fail, it destroys an image but has no additional effect (even if the attack would normally have an effect on a failure) if an attack roll is a critical success and would hit one of the images, one of the images is destroyed and the attack roll becomoes a success against you. Once all the iamges are destroyed, the spell ends.

The spell ends after 1 round\nFailure As success, but the effect lasts 1 minute\nCritical Failure As failure, except the target believes that everyone it sees is a mortal enemy. It uses its reactions and free actions against everyone, regardless of whether they were previously its allies, as determined by the GM.

The target's response to the treasure is based on the outcome of the target's Will save\nCritical Success The target is unaffected\nSuccess The target beomces fascinated with the treasure, and the duration is until the end of its turn. The target can also try to disbelieve the illusion if it touches the treasure, Seeks to examine it, or speaks to it if the illusion appears to be a person or the like. If the target disbelieves the illusion, the spell ends\nFailure As success, but the duration is 1 minute\nCritical Failure As success, but the duration is 1 minute. The target finds the treasure so appealing that until the spell ends, it must spend each action focused on it. This can include  moving toward the treasure if the target isn't next to it, and Interacting with the treasure if the target is next to it. (If the illusion appears to be a person or the like, the target can also Interact to converse with it)

It sheds bright light in the spell's area, and dim light to twice that area.

Living creatures and undead in the area when you Cast this Spell, or that enter the area later, must attempt Fortitude saves. Living creatures that fail their Fortitude saves gain only half the normal benefit from healing effects while within the area. Undead targets that fail their Fortitude saves become enfeebled 1 while within the area.

Unlike most spells, you can gain this effect multiple times in the same round by Sustaining this Spell multiple times. The orb can move through the spaces of any creatures or obstacles that wouldn't stop the flow of water. It extinguishes non-magical fires it moves through of its size or smaller, and it attempts to counteract any magical fires it moves through. If it fails to counteract a given fire, it can't counteract that fire for the duration of the spell.\nThe orb can also collect creatures it moves through. Any Large or smaller creature whose space the orb tries to move through can attempt a Reflex save against your spell DC to avoid being engulfed. If a creature succeeds at this save, it can either let the orb pass (remaining in its space or moving out of the orb's path into a space of the creature's choice) or allow itself to be pushed in front of the orb to the end of the orb's movement. The orb can try to Engulf the same creature only once per turn, even if you roll it onto a creature's space more than once.\nA creature that fails its save is pulled into the orb. It becomes grabbed, moves along with the orb, and must hold its breath or begin suffocating (unless it can breathe in water). An engulfed Medium or smaller creature and anyone trying to affect that creature follow the normal rules for aquatic battles. An engulfed Large creature is usually big enough that parts of it stick out from the water, and it can reach out of the water. An engulfed creature can get free either by Swimming with a successful DC 10 Athletics check or by Escaping against your spell DC. A creature that critically failed its Reflex save is further stuck and must attempt to Escape instead of Swim. A freed creature exits the orb's space and can immediately breathe. The orb can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.\nWhen the spell ends, all creatures the orb has engulfed are automatically released.

When you cast this spell, choose ant, beetle, centipede, mantis, scorpion, or spider. You can decide the specific type of animal (such as a ladybug or scarab for beetle), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss this spell.\nYou gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:\n--AC=18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction. --10 temporary Hit Points --Low-light vision --One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use.

Invisibility Sphere	Spell	3	Illusion	Arcane, Occult	[2] material, somatic	10-foot emanation	None	You and any number of creatures in range	None	10 minutes	You and all targets are invisible except to each other as long as you remain within the spell's area. If a creature made invisible by this spell leaves the spell's area, it becomes visible and remains so even if it returns to the spell's area. If any creature made invisible by this spell uses a hostile action, the spell ends after the hostile action is completed.\nWHile exploring, it's easy to move together slowly and remain invisible. This is untenable in a battle, however. Once an encounter begins, creatures remain invisible until at most the end of the first round, at which point the spell ends. {Heightened (5th) The duration increases to 1 hour}
Levitate	Spell	3	Evocation	Arcane, Occult	[2] somatic, verbaal	None	touch	1 unattended object or willing creature	None	5 minutes	You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground.

A floating creature can spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If the target is adjacent to a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it can move across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical, like a wall) or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling).

If the target is a specific object, you must have observed it directly with your own senses. If it's a type of object, you still need to have an accurate mental image of the type of object. If there's lead or running water between you and the target, this spell can't locate the object. This means you might find a type of object farther away if the nearest one is behind lead or running water. {Heightened (5th) You can target a specific creature or ancestry instead of an object, but you must have met or seen up close the creature or ancestry you want to target}
Mad Monkeys	Spell	3	Conjuration	Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	5-foot burst	30 feet	None	None	sustained up to 1 minute	Magical monkey spirits fill the area as they pile and climb on top of one another.

They produce the effect listed for that mischief when you Cast this Spell and each round when you Sustain this Spell. When you Sustain this Spell, you can move the area of the monkeys by 5 feet.\n--Flagrant Burglary. The monkeys try to Steal any one item from one creature in the area. Use your spell DC - 10 as the monkeys' Thievery modifier. Their attempt relies more on distraction than subtlety, so the victim knows what item the monkeys were trying to take and whether it was taken. Getting a stolen item from the monkeys, even for the caster, requires Stealing it from them or Disarming them, using your spell DC. When the spell ends, any stolen items fall to the ground in any square of the spell's area you choose. --Raucous Din The monkeys screech loudly, potentially deafening creatures in the spell's area, interfering with complex movements. Each creature in the spell's area must attempt a Fortitude save.\nCritical Success The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 10 minutes\nSuccess the creature is unaffected\nFailure The creature is deafened for 1 minute\nCritical Failure The creature is deafened for 1 minute. --Tumultuous Gymnastics The monkeys jump and climb all over creatures in the spell's area, interfering with complex movements. Each creature in the spell's area must attempt a Reflex save.\nCritical Success The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 10 minutes\nSuccess The creature is unaffected\nFailure For 1 round, the creature must succeed at a DC 5 flat check whenever it attempts a manipulate action. If it fails this check, the creature loses that action\nCritical Failure As failure, but the monkeys cling to the creature tenaciously, and the effect lasts until the spell ends, even if the creature leaves the spell's area.

Nondetection attempts counteract all detection, revelation, and scrying divinations made against the target or the target's gear throughout the duration, counting cantrips as 1st-level spells for this purpose.

Once during the duration of this spell, the target can roll one Perception, Arcana, Crafting, Lore, Occultism, or Society initiative roll twice and use the better result, after which the spell ends. The strain of staying so prepared is too much for a mind to handle for long; the target is temporarily immune to this spell for 24 hours once the spell ends, whether they used the initiative benefit or not.

Furthermore, the spell prevents anything in the area that's prone to collapse, such as a rickety bridge or an unstable ceiling, from collapsing, except under extreme strain that would collapse a normal structure of its type.\nSafe Passage protects only against harm, not inconvenience, and it doesn't reduce difficulty terrain, remove the concealed condition caused by precipitation, or the like, nore does it protect agianst creatures within the spell's area. {Heightened (5th) The granted resistance increases to 10, and the area can be 120 feet long || Heightened (8th) The granted resistance increases to 15, and the area can be 500 feet long}

A creature who succeeds at a Perception check against you spell DC can determine that the sound was altered by an illusion, including hearing faint sounds if you deadened the sound, but they can't determine the trye sound unless they critically succeed at the Perception check. You can Dismiss this spell.\nBecause this spell obscures sound instead of preventing it, using the spell to quiet a creature doesn't prevent that creature from using verbal spell components, though it does prevent most auditory effects that rely on another creature hearing them accurately. An unwilling target can attempt a Will save\nSuccess The affected sound from the creature isn't altered.\nFaulure The affected sound from the creature is altered in the way you determine\nCritical Failure The affected sound from the creature is altered and the target becomes stupefied 2 for 1 minute as it struggles with the disorienting effects of its altered sound {Heighened (5th) You can target up to 6 creatures or 6 objects, altering the sounds of all affected creatures or objects in the same way}

Wanderer's Guide	Spell	3	Divination	Divine, Occult	1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)	None	None	None	None	until your next daily preparations	You call upon the beyond to guide your route. When you Cast this Spell, choose a destination: you receive an inspired route to that destination, allowing you and your allies who travel overland with you to reduce the movement penalty from difficult terrain by half for the duration, as long as you don't deviate from the inspired route. This doesn't have any effect on movement during encounters. If you use this ability again before the duration is over, this effect ends and is replaced by that of the new route.
Whirling Scarves	Spell	3	Abjuration, Force	Divine, Occult	[2] somatic, verbal	None	None	None	None	1 minute	You surround yourself in a vortex of whirling colorful scarves of force that obfuscate you and disorient your foes. You gain the benefits of the concealed condition, but only against ranged and melee attacks. When a melee attack fails to hit you because of the flat check for the concealed condition, the scarves snag the weapon or unarmed attack, and the creature takes a -1 circumstance penalty to further attacks with that weapon or unarmed attack until the end of its turn (or the end of its next turn, if it wasn't the creature's turn). The timing of the scarves' movement is harder to predict for ranged attackers, so the flat check for the concealed condition against ranged attacks increases from DC 5 to DC 6. You can Dismiss this Spell {Heighened (+2) The circumstance penalty to further attacks with a melee weapon or unarmed attack the scarves snag increases by 1. The DC of the flat check for the concealed condition against ranged attacks increases by 1}

When you cast this spell, choose acid, cold, fire, electricity, or poison damage. You gain resistance 5 against that type of damage. The scales' color depends on the damage type you chose and is usually the color of a type of dragon or other creature associated with that damage type, such as red or gold for fire damage.\nThe scales store up energy as they protect you.

This space can be reached only by climbing the rope\nThe entrance to the space can't be seen, and it can be pinpointed only by the presence of the rope. The rope can't be removed or hidden, though it can be detached from the extradimensional space by pulling it with 16,000 pounds of weight, critically succeeding at an Athletics check against the spell's DC, or destroying the rope. The space hold up to eight Medium creatures and their gear. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures and a Gargantuan creature fills the space on its own.\nIf the rope is detached or destroyed, or if a creature attempts to enter the space that would put it over its capacity, the space begins to unravel.

Rusting Grasp	Spell	4	Transmutation	Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	None	touch	1 metal creature, 1 non-magical metal hazard, or 1 non-magicla metal item of up to 1 Bulk	None	0	You cause the target to rapidly rust. This magical rust can affect nonferrous materials, but the target must be all or mostly metal. Skymetals such as adamantine and orichalcum are immune to this rust, and the GM might determine other precious materials are similarly resilient. Ultimately, the GM decides if an object or creature can be targeted with this spell. All damage from this spell ignores Hardness. If the spell causes persistent damage from rust, a creature can attempt to scrape off the rust to assist the target in recovering from the persistent damage (reducing the DC of the flat check to end persistent damage to 10 and granting an immediate flat check). The effect of the spell depends on the target\n--Creature or Hazard A creaure or hazard must be made of all or mostly metal to be affected (this includes many mechanical traps). It takes 8d6 damage (basic Fortitude save), plus 2d6 persistent damage on a failed save. Touching a hazard to affect it with this spell might trigger the hazard, as determined by the GM. --Item The rust deals 2d6 damage, subject to a basic Reflex save by the creature wearing or holding the item; if the item is unattended, it automatically gets a critical failure. On a failed save, the item also takes 1d6 persistent damage. For an attended item, this persistent damage occurs at the end of the attending creature's turns; if the item was unattended when you Cast this Spell, the damage happens at the end of your turns\nWhen targeting armor someone is wearing, its Bulk is 1 higher than the listed value, since carrying armor is more cumbersome than wearing it. Thin iron or steel items, such as weapons, have 20 HP and a Broken Threshold of 10, and thicker iron or steel items, such as most suits of armor, have 36 HP and a Broken Threshold of 18. Other materials' statistics can be found in the Material Statistics section and in the entries precious materials {Heightened (+1) Increase the initial damage to creatures or hazards by 2d6, and increase the maximum Bulk of an item you can target by 1}

This spell calls on the physical body's latent memories rather than summoning back the deceased's spirit, so the corpse must be mostly intact for the spell to function.

The corpse can attempt a Will save to resist answering the questions using the statistics of the original creature at its time of death, with the following effects\nCritical Success The target can lie or refuse to answer your questions, and the target's spirit haunts you for 24 hours, bothering you and causing you to be unable to gain any rest for that time\nSuccess The target can provide false information or refuse to answer your questions\nFailure The target must answer truthfully, but its answers can be brief, cryptic, and repetitive.

The spell doesn't change voice, scent, or mannerisms. You choose the disguise for each target; for example, you could make one target appear to be a dwarf and another an elf.\nCasting Veil counts as setting up a disguise for the purpose of the Impersonate action.

False Vision	Spell	5	Uncommon, Illusion	Arcane, Occult	10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)	100-foot burst	touch	None	None	until the next time you make your daily preparations	You create a false image that fools any attempts to scry on an area. Any scrying spell sees, hears, smells, and otherwise detects whatever you wish within the area, rather than what is actually in the area. You can Sustain this Spell each round to change the illusion as you desire, including playing out a complex scene. If the scrying spell is of a higher level than false vision, the scryer can attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the illusion, though even if they're successful, they can't learn what's truly going on in the area.
Flame Strike	Spell	5	Evocation, Fire	Divine	[2] somatic, verbal	10-foot radius, 40-foot tall cylinder	120 feet	None	basic Reflex	0	You call a rain of divine fire that plummets down from above, dealing 8d6 fire damage. Because the flame is infused with divine energy, creatures in the area apply only half their usual fire resistance. Creatures that are immune to fire, instead of gaining the usual benefit of immunity, treat the results of their saving throws as one degree of success better. {Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6}
Grisly Growths	Spell	5	Transmutation	Arcane, Primal	[2] somatic, verbal	None	60 feet	1 corporeal creature	basic Fortitude	0	This gruesome spell causes the target to grow excess limbs and organs, whether it be fingers multiplying until hands resemble bushes, eyes popping open in bizarre places, legs sprouting from the side of th ebody, or some other result. The target takes 10d6 piercing damage (basic Fortitude save) as the new features erupt. This spell has no effect on a target with a mutable anatomy or no limbs, such as an ooze or a protean. The growths rot rapidly and fall away after 1 round.\nIn addition, unless the initial target critically succeeds, creatures within 30 feet of the target, including the target, must attempt Will saves, after which they are temporarily immune to this secondary effect of Grisly Growths for 1 hour. This additionaal effect is a mentla and visual effect\nSuccess The creature is unaffected\nFailure The creature is sickened 1\nCritical Failure the creature is sickened 2 {Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6}
Hallucination	Spell	5	Illusion, Incapacitation, Mental	Arcane, Occult	[2] material, somatic	None	30 feet	1 creature	None	1 hour	The target consistently detects one thing as another, can't detect something that's there, or detects something that's not there, though it doesn't alter their beliefs. You choose which of these effects applies, and you determine the specifics of the hallucination. For example, you could make the target see all elves as humans, be unable to detect the presence of their brother, see their beloved pocket watch on their person even when it isn't, or see a tower in the center of town\nThe target can attempt an initial Will save, with effects below. They also receive a Will save to disbelieve the hallucination every time they Seek or directly interact with the hallucination. For example, the target could attempt to disbelieve the hallucination each time they interacted with an elf, bumped into their brother accidentally, tried to check their pocked watch, or studied the tower. The target can attempt to disbelieve with a large circumstance bonus in situations determined by the GM, such as if the target attempted to climb the nonexistent tower\nCritical Success The creature is unaffected\nSuccess The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves, but it knows what the hallucination is\nFailure The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves\nCritical Failure The creature perceives what you chose until it disbelieves, and it trusts its false senses, taking a -4 circumstance penalty to saves to disbelieve {Heightened (6th) Choose to either target up to 10 creatures or change the spell's duration to until the next time you make your daily preparations || Heightened (8th) Choose to either targeet any number of creatures or change the spell's duration to unlimited}
Illusory Scene	Spell	5	Auditory, Illusion, Olfactory, Visual	Arcane, Primal	10 minutes (somatic, verbal)	30-foot burst	500 feet	None	None	1 hour	You form an imaginary scene that includes up to 10 discrete creatures or objects of various sizes, all of which must be within the spell's area. These elements generate appropriate sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike with the Illusory Creature spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a Hallucinatory Terrain spell.\nWhen you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion\nAny creature that touches any part of the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. If they interact with a portion of the illusion, they disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene only on a critical success {Heightened (6th) Creatures or objects in your scene can speak. You must speak the specific lines for each actor when creating your program. The spell disguises your voice for each actor || Heightened (8th) As the 6th-level version, and the duration is unlimited}
